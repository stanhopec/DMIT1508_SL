-- EXAMPLE 1 -- "CustomerView"
-- Create a view that shows a customer's full name, phone number, city, email, and how many receipts they are attached to.

-- EXAMPLE 2 -- "CustomerTotalPurchaseView"
-- take the view from example 1, change the name, and modify it so that instead of showing how many receipts, show the total 
-- number of items they have bought at the store. 

-- EXAMPLE 3 --
-- create a view that shows the album information but where the Album table has IDs, show what the IDs correspond to.
-- (You probably want to set column headings so they make sense...)

-- EXAMPLE 4 --
-- Create a view that shows receipts with all the relevant information in stead of the "ID"s
-- (Create useful column headings!)
